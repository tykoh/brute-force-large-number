# Brute Force on Large Number
1. To generate a large X bit number, where X can be 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 bit
2. Generate a random key according to the number of bits
3. Output the time taken to brute force the random key generated

## How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the following command
```bash
python3 brute_force.py
```
3. Enter the number of bits
4. The program will generate a random key and output the time taken to brute force the key
